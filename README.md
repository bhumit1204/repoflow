# repoflow
Repoflow is a custom-built, lightweight version control system designed to demonstrate how core VCS concepts like initialization, tracking, committing, diffing, logging, and restoring can be implemented from scratch.  Unlike Git, Repoflow focuses on clarity over complexity, making it ideal for learning, experimentation, and technical interviews.
